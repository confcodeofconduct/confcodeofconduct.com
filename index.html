<h1>Slack Channel Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our slack channel are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>You have our contact details in the emails we&#39;ve sent.</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>Our slack channel is dedicated to providing a harassment-free slack channel experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of slack channel participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any slack channel venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Channel participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the slack channel <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the slack channel organisers.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the slack channel organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the slack channel with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of channel admins immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>

<p>Channel admins will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the slack channel. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at slack channel and workshop venues and slack channel-related social events.</p>
