<h1>Conference Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>You have our contact details in the emails we&#39;ve sent.</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a positive experience, especially concerning the law. We do not tolerate theft, deterioration, harassment, use or resale of drugs, driving under influence, organization of insider trading against start-ups, or other breach of the law. This includes talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Theft and deterioration include the equipment and buildings at the site of the conference or made available by the organizers outside of this place. They also include the belongings of the audience, and private belongings of the organizers.</p>

<p>Deliberate intimidation, be it before the conference, during or after, and whether or not it is sexual or about ticket sales or about illicit substances, is forbidden.</p>

<p>Sponsors, participants, speakers and organizers all commit to notify law enforcement authorities any illicit situation they witness.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>Notably, if you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>

<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
