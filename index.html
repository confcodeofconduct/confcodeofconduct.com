<h1>Slack Channel Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers of our slack channel are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Channel admins will enforce this code throughout. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>You can find out the current channel admins on our <a href="https://melbournealtnet.slack.com/team">team page</a>.</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>Our slack channel is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any channel or other medium including, Twitter and other online media. Channel participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the slack channel at the discretion of the slack channel admins.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. </p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the slack channel organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the slack channel.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a channel admin immediately. Channel admins can be identified on our <a href="https://melbournealtnet.slack.com/team">team page.</p>

<p>Channel admins  will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your participation.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules in the slack channel and other Melbourne ALT.NET related events.</p>
