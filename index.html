    <p>
      All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are

      enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
      participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

      <h2>Important notice</h2>
      <p>
        This code of conduct page is a template and <strong>should not be considered as
        enforceable</strong>. If an event has linked to this page, please ask them to
        publish their own code of conduct including details on how to report

    <h2>The Quick Version</h2>

    <p>
      Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
      experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
      expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
      size, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
      We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
      Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
      including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
      Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
      expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion
      of the conference organisers.
    </p>

    <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
      identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
      sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
      talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
      sexual attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
      sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
      Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers
      may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
      or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
      have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
      immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing
      branded clothing and/or badges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
      security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
      those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
      conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop
      venues and conference-related social events.
